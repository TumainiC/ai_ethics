Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.
Algorithmic bias is when systemic error in machine learning algorithms produce unfair and discriminatory outcomes. 

It manifests in AI systems because of poor undiversified training data that causes the AI to learn biased patterns such as in the Amazon hiring tool. 
It can also be introduced by a developer when building and training the model. The developer may choose to penalized the model due to subjective choices and this introduces bias to the algorithmn. 

Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?
Transparency in AI means being able to see clearly what the model does and having that information be available. Explainability means being able to understand why themodel behaves in a certain way and the steps that lead it to get to those decisions

Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?
The GDPR clearly states that all collected data must be consetually collected to be used in model training for example. It gives users the right to privacy of their own data and for it to be accesses there has to be conscent for this. This impacts AI development in the sense that companies cannot collect user dtat without their concent and cannot use that data collected unconcentually to train their models. This may slow down development due to lack of enough data or if data is unlawfully collected, the company pays billions in fines such as in the GDPR 

## 2. Ethical Principles Matching

**A) Justice** - Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.

**B) Non-maleficence** - Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.

**C) Autonomy** - Respecting users' right to control their data and decisions.

**D) Sustainability** - Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.
